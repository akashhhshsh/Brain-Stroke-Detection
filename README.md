## Introduction
Brain strokes are a major cause of disability and death globally. Early detection can greatly improve patient outcomes. This project explores machine learning and deep learning models to classify MRI images as either stroke-positive or stroke-negative, aiming to assist medical professionals in making quicker, more accurate diagnoses.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of MRI images of brain scans categorized into two classes:
1. Stroke-positive images
2. Stroke-negative images

### Data Preprocessing
- Images were resized to 128x128 for efficient processing.
- Pixel values were normalized to [0,1] for both SVM and CNN models.
- Image augmentation was applied to create variations and improve model generalization.

## Models Used

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Architecture:** Linear kernel, with feature extraction by flattening images.
- **Parameters:** Regularization (C=0.1) for improved generalization.
- **Preprocessing:** Flattened and normalized images.
- **Advantages:** Quick training, interpretable results, and effective on smaller datasets.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Architecture:** Consists of convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers.
- **Parameters:** Used ReLU activation, dropout for regularization, and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalized images and used data augmentation.
- **Advantages:** Strong learning capabilities for complex patterns and effective with image data.

### Comparative Analysis:
- The SVM model was lightweight and efficient, performing reasonably well on non-augmented data.
- The CNN model, though requiring more computational resources, outperformed SVM in accuracy due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Data Imbalance**: The dataset was slightly imbalanced, which could lead to biased results. This was mitigated by data augmentation and appropriate evaluation metrics.
2. **Feature Dimensionality for SVM**: Flattening images increased feature dimensionality, impacting SVM performance. Reducing image resolution to 128x128 was a compromise.
3. **Computational Resources**: CNN training was computationally intensive, requiring significant GPU resources for faster iteration.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning Complexity**: Selecting optimal parameters for SVM and CNN required extensive experimentation and cross-validation.

## Future Scope
1. **Advanced Architectures**: Exploring deeper architectures like VGG16, ResNet, or transfer learning could enhance model performance.
2. **Larger Dataset**: A larger, more diverse dataset would improve model generalization.
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining SVM and CNN models or experimenting with ensemble methods could yield more robust predictions.
4. **Real-time Deployment**: Implementing real-time prediction capabilities for clinical use.
